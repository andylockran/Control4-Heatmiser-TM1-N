# Control4-Heatmiser-TM1-N
TM1-N Driver for Hot Water Timer for Control4

Control4 (www.control4.com) is a home-automation provider.

I happen to have a system, and despite being frustrated by the closed-source nature of the beast, want to write some open source drivers to allow me to use the home automation system to do more than what's in the box.

This project is to provide hot-water capabilities to the TM1-N Heatmiser Thermostat.  If you want to interface with the thermostat yourself outside of Control4, this project should still provide the necessary logic to do so. 

The other repository that I run against this project is the heatmiser-v3-scripts forked from work I found dead on google code.
